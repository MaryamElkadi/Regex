# Regex
This project involves solving various text pattern matching problems using Regular Expressions (Regex) in Java. Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern, primarily used for string matching within texts. Regex is widely used for data validation, parsing, and replacing text in many applications.

In this project, we focus on solving common problems using Java's built-in Pattern and Matcher classes. The project includes implementing regex solutions for a variety of tasks, such as validating email addresses, phone numbers, extracting certain patterns, and more.
This project contains the following problems solved using Java regex:

# Technologies Used
Java: The project is built using Java's built-in Pattern and Matcher classes to perform regex operations.
Java 8+: The solution uses Java 8 features such as Lambda Expressions and Streams for efficient pattern matching and string processing.
